4: True Gameplay
  Now that the game has begun, the normal mechanics of the game will loop through this section: Making sure the pet is fed, clean, happy, and well rested. From this point on, the points for health/food/happy and timers will be started and kept track of.
    Available visual states the user should be able to see in order to know what their Pet needs!
      -  ðŸ’€ (sick,->toilet not cleaned after 5 min),
        sent with "Your Pet Tamagotchi is Down with The Sickness!"
       * The user CANNOT play with pet when it is Sick.

5. Endgame Event
  Depending on how users play the game, we will have a branching off! Either the pet dies or it evolves into its final form c:
    A.) PERISH EVENT: Occurs when Sick for longer than 10 mins(game units, doesn't have to be minutes)
                    Occurs when Hunger Empty for longer than 10 mins
                    occurs when Happy bar is empty for longer than 10 mins
        If Pet perishes, users will experience the following behavior:
            -send sms "Oh no... Oh dear... It looks lke your <<name>> Tamagotchi has Perished from <<sickness, starvation, boredom>>...
            - sms send: "<<name>> OBITUARY:
                          Your beloved pet has crossed the rainbow bridge. Either you were parentally challenged, or you hated your pet. Will you take the journey of parenthood seriously next time? Y or N"
                          >>user enters YES of NO
                         No matter what their answer is, the game will be reset.
                         
    B.) EVOLUTION EVENT: Occurs when all bars have been kept full for 10+ mins
                    (potential for random gift of evolve stone?)
                    
        The users will see the following behavior once their pet is ready to evolve.
          -send sms with an excited ascii(or exclamation point)
          "Oh..? What's this..? ...... It looks like your Tamagotchi is ready to evolve to its Final Form!"
          - Depending on the tamagotchi the user chose in the beginning of the game, the SMS should send an ascii art of the final form of the creature, which will be decided based on spicy,sweet or sour!
          >> SMS send photo of final form of pet

          Spicy:
            - "Your Bat Tamagotchi has evolved into a CUNNING VAMPIRE! Will it be bloodthirsty or a wierdo like Edward Cullen? We don't know, but at least you helped it to survive through childhood! Congratulations!!!"
            
          Sweet: 
          - "Your LadyBug Tamagotchi has evolved into LOVELY CUPID! Will it have the best interest of each lover in mind or will it play God with the fates of mortal hearts? We don't know, but at least you helped it to survive through childhood! Congratulations!!!"
          
          Sour:
            "Your Octopus Tamagotchi has evolved into ELDRITCH HORROR CTHULU! Will it stay hidden and slumbering under the ocean's depths for millenia or will it awaken and unleash a wrath unto mankind unlike nothing anyone has ever seen? We don't know, but at least you helped it to survive through childhood! Congratulations!!!"
